# Project Outline
> Created by [Ted Thavisin] for COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science.

In the project outline, you will specify details about the type of application that you will develop. Your project outline should answer the following questions:

## Project Idea

**What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else?  What will your project do?**

For this project, I’m building an **iOS** app that can predict stock trends. The idea is to create a simple mobile app that shows users semi-accurate predictions on where certain stocks might go, based on real-time data from the stock market. The app will use a stock market **API** to pull in information like past prices, trading volume, and other basic stats. Hopefully, I can later implement the AI to take news as an input for its predictions.
The main feature will be an AI that makes these predictions. The app’s predictions aren’t going to be perfect, but the goal is that they’ll give a general sense of where a stock might head. The AI will keep learning from its past predictions, whether it was correct or wrong. If it makes a prediction that ends up being wrong, it’ll try to improve by adjusting based on what actually happened and train the AI.
The user interface (UI) will be intuitive, clean, and easy to use, with a focus on showing the key info and predictions in a simple way. Users will be able to see stock predictions and recent price trends without getting lost in complex data. In addition, it could have guides and helpful tools to use as well. There could also be a more data-based interface implemented for people who are experts. Examples of how I want it to look are apps like **Webull** or **Robinhood**, which are very user-friendly. In the end, the app will be a helpful tool for people who want a quick snapshot of where the market could go.

**Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?**

I choose to work on this topic specifically because I want to learn more about AI and how it works. I also want to learn how to create an **iOS** app using **Swift** and **Xcode** which I am also learning in AppTeam Club. I feel like building an app that uses AI to predict stock trends seems like a good way to explore these two things hands-on. I personally invest in stocks with my own money so I think having an app that would help me make decisions would also be a good idea. I think that there is not that much information to help people choose which stocks to go with so I feel like this fills in that gap that I personally have encountered. Also, I think getting an introduction into AI would be helpful for the rest of my career as well. 



## Project Impact

**Who is the target audience of this project? Be specific about the demographic (age / occupation), the type of devices they might use to run it (computer, Apple phone, smartwatch, etc).**
*Note: If your final project deliverable is not a tangible app or program, talk instead about who your project benefits.*

The primary target audience for this project is young adults, particularly beginners who are just getting into the stock market. Most of these users will likely range from 18 to 30 years old. The minimum age of 18 is important because individuals typically can't open an investment account until they’re legally considered an adult. These users would also have financial capital to invest with, meaning they most likely have a source of income or savings. Many users in this age group are eager to learn about the stock market but may feel intimidated by the complexity of financial data and analysis. A secondary target audience would be everyone else who would want to invest their money in something other than a bank. The main device that people would use to run the app would be an **iOS** device, such as an iPhone, since the purpose of the app is to be easily accessible and convenient. An iPhone app format using Swift would allow for a clean, simple UI that will only display the important information. This app's goal is to make stock predictions easier to understand and read, helping new investors get familiar with stock trends in a way that's easy and accessible. 



**What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your project?**

This project aims to tackle the problem of stock market complexity and choice of stock for beginners. New investors, especially young adults, like myself, often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information and the financial jargon involved in the stock market. Without a good understanding of how stock trends work, it’s easy to feel lost or make poor decisions based on limited knowledge. The app I'm building will hopefully address this problem by providing simplified, AI-driven predictions for stock movements, allowing users a sense of what might happen next in the market. There will be straightforward predictions with explanations for each one that will be easy to understand without the need for deep financial expertise. By targeting beginners, this app benefits young investors by making stock market analysis more accessible and less intimidating. Instead of feeling like they need a background in finance, users will have a helpful tool to build their understanding of the stock market, helping them make more informed decisions as they grow as investors.
