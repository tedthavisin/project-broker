# Getting Started Tutorials

For this part of the assignment, you will complete a Getting Started tutorial based on the track that you have selected *or* that you have developed in collaboration with Ajay or Noah. To submit the code / files for the getting started tutorials you complete, please upload them in this `/getting-started/` directory.

**IMPORTANT:** Note that your final project repositories are ***private** repositories* by default. It is encouraged for you to show off the work you have completed during the getting started tutorials you complete. To do this, you may need to:
1) Create a new, public repository on GitHub.
2) Upload your completed code to this public repository.

For these public repositories to count, please paste the links below. You are not required to create a separate public repository for your work, but it may be a great way to add something to your portfolio.
